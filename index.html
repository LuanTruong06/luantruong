        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
    I am fascinated by science, especially our solar system as well as a software developer. When I was young, I dreamed of working a the computer environment. 
    Therefore, I am taking the Computer Engineering Technology program at Sheridan College to pursue my childhood dream. I have a passion for programming, 
    and technology devices. During the time I studied at Sheridan College and had a part-time job at fast food restaurant, I acquired a lot of essential skills such 
    as time management, problem-solving, customer service, and deeply know how to work in a fast-paced and multi-cultural environment. Moreover, I am now self-studying to
    enhance my Java programming skills, design pattern skills, and JavaScript, as well as Python in the nearest future. Finally, I am highly active, enthusiastic, and 
    extremely friendly.
